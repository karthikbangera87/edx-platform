include ways to:

* :ref:`Find Posts`

* :ref:`Keep Up with New Activity`

* :ref:`Follow Posts`

* :ref:`Vote for Posts or Responses`

* :ref:`Report Discussion Misuse`

.. _Find Posts:

==================
Find Posts
==================

Finding out whether someone else has already started a conversation about the
subject you're interested in, and then reading and contributing to that
exchange instead of starting a new one, helps make course discussions more
productive for everyone. You can search for something specific or you can
browse through the posts in a single discussion topic.

Search the Discussions
****************************

To search for text, click **Discussion** and enter a phrase, a word, or part of
a word in the **Search all posts** field above the list of posts. When you
press Enter, the search tries to find:

* An exact match to your text in any post, response, or comment. A list of
  the posts that have an exact match at any interaction level displays.

* A similar value in any post, response, or comment (if no exact matches are
  found). A "No results found for {text}. Showing results for {similar}"
  message displays above the list of posts that have similar text at any
  interaction level.

* Any usernames that are an exact match to your text. A "Show posts by
  {username}" option displays above any posts that have an exact match at any
  interaction level. Click the username in the message to read that user's
  posts, responses, and comments.

Review Posts About a Single Topic
**************************************

To review posts about a particular part of the course or type of issue, click
**Discussion** and then select a topic from the drop-down list. (**All
Discussions** is selected by default.) Only posts about the topic you select
appear in the list of posts.

.. _Keep Up with New Activity:

===========================
Keep Up with New Activity
===========================

Read New or Updated Posts
***********************************

The list of posts provides visual cues to help you identify posts that are new,
or that have responses or comments that you have not read yet, and distinguish
them from exchanges that you have already read completely.

* Posts that you have not read yet have a blue dialog "bubble". 

* Posts with responses or comments that you have not read yet have a white
  dialog "bubble".
 
* Exchanges that you have read completely have a gray dialog "bubble" and
  background.

Receive Daily Digests
***********************

You have the option to receive an email message that summarizes discussion
activity for the posts you are following during the last day. To receive this
daily digest, click **Discussion** and then select the **Receive updates**
checkbox.

.. _Follow Posts:

=====================
Follow Posts
=====================

If you find a post particularly interesting and want to return to it again in
the future, you can follow it: view that post and click the star icon in its
top right corner.

Each post that you follow appears with a "Following" badge in the list of
posts.

To list only the posts that you are following, regardless of the discussion
topic they apply to, click the drop-down Discussion list and select
**Posts I'm Following**.

post or response and click the **+** at top right.

You can sort the list of posts so that the posts with the most votes appear at
the top: click the drop-down list of sorting options and select **by most
votes**.

Report Discussion Misuse

You can flag any post, response, or comment for a discussion moderator to
review: view the post or response and then click **Report Misuse**. For a
